# 2048 Game & AI
Created the game in Python then implemented an AI that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to find the optimal move in any scenario.

# How To Play
The goal of the game is simple, combine tiles to reach the 2048 tile. This is done by using the w, a, s, d keys to shift the board in a direction that combines like tiles along the way. After each move, a random tile is added that can either be a 2 or a 4. 
If you run out of open spaces with no valid moves to make, you lose. Run the 2048.py file to get started. If you want the AI to take over for one move use the 'q' key, if you want the AI to play the rest of the game, use the 'p' key.
Press 'r' to restart once the game is over.
